# VVV Custom site template
Very simple directory template for VVV Project.

This is unlikely to compatible with built-in site-template system. Just download this repo and update configuration.

# Configuration
Add this configuration into `vvv-custom.yaml` and change value accordingly

```yaml
wp63:
  vm_dir: /srv/www/wp63
  local_dir: /Users/WP63/Projects/wp63-test
  hosts:
    - wp63.test
```
